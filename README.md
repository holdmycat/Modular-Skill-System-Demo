# Modular-Skill-System-Demo
A decoupled, high-performance skill architecture from a shipped Steam title. Features event-driven logic, behavior trees, and full-chain pooling in Unity URP.

Production pipeline (Excel -> Proto) is detailed in the Toolkit repo. This demo uses baked ScriptableObjects to ensure standalone functionality.
