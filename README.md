# Designer-First Skill Framework
**Zero code duplication · 100+ skill variants fully owned by designers**

![Designer-First Demo](Images/banner.png) ← 38-second uncut demo

Duplicate one data row → tweak 4 values → new skill instantly works.  
No graph duplication. No new script.

**Used daily for 12 months of full-team development.**

Try it in 20 seconds: open `Scenes/DesignerWorkflow_Showcase.unity` → Play

### Real Impact
- Engineers build archetype graphs **once**
- Designers own all variants **forever**
- Measured output when I wore both hats: **25–40 balanced variants/day**  
  (vs. 4–6 with traditional copy-paste workflow)

### Bonus 2025 killer feature (coming late Dec 2025)

SkillForge AI – type natural language → get a fully playable skill in <3 min
60-second live demo + full integration will be shipped by end of Dec 2025.
Already works locally – polishing editor UI and safeguards before open-source drop.
