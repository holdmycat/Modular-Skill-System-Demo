**38-second uncut live demo drops Dec 5, 2025** (this Friday)  
→ Duplicate one data row → tweak 4 values → new skill instantly works  
→ No graph duplication · No new script · Zero engineer bottleneck

Used daily for 12 months of full-team Steam development.
Try the exact workflow right now (20 seconds):  
Open `Scenes/ShowcaseScene.unity` → Play

### Real Impact
- Engineers build archetype graphs **once**
- Designers own all variants **forever**
- Measured output when I wore both hats: **25–40 balanced variants/day**  
  (vs. 4–6 with traditional copy-paste workflow)

### Bonus 2025 killer feature (coming late Dec 2025)

SkillForge AI – type natural language → get a fully playable skill in <3 min
60-second live demo + full integration will be shipped by end of Dec 2025.
Already works locally – polishing editor UI and safeguards before open-source drop.
